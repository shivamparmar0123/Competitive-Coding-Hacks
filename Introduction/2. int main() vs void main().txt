Always use 

int main()
{


	return 0;// do not forget to put this at the end of code
}

The int returned by main() is a way for a program 
to return a value to “the system” that invokes it. 
On systems that doesn’t provide such a facility the return value is ignored, 
but that doesn’t make “void main()” legal C++ or legal C. 
Even if your compiler accepts “void main()” avoid it, 
or risk being considered ignorant by C and C++ programmers.
