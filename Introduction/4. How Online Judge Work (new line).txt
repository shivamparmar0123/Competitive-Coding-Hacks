In layman language-

Online judge prints your output in a text file and 
compare it with the text file provided by problem setter

What happen if we forget to put \n (new line) after printing solution for various test case

Let's assume a problem in which you have to print first 5 odd number

Your text file looks like
1 3 5 7 9

Problem setter's text file looks like
1
3
5
7
9

Since two files are not similar even though your solutions are correct
So
Online Judge treats it as a wrong solution.
